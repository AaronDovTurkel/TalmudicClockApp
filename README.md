# Talmudic Clock App

The ["Talmudic Clock App"](https://aarondovturkel.github.io/TalmudicClockApp/) is a modern sun-dial designed to display the hour of the day as calculated in Jewish law with reference to the varying lengths of the days and nights. It also allows you to list Jewish prayer times.

## Usage

The "Talmudic Clock App' opens with basic page info and instructions. Clicking the "exit" button 
renders the analog-clock interface. As described in the info section, this clock displays the
"talmudic hour". The Talmud uses "temporal hours" ("Shaos Zmanios" in Hebrew) which are one twelfth of the day (sunrise to sunset) and night (sunset to sunrise) to calculate correct prayer times.

Following the instuctions found in the opening "info" section, clicking on the settings gear (located at the bottom-right
of the view-port) will display a list of new options.
