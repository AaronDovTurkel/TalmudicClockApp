The ["Talmudic Clock App"](https://aarondovturkel.github.io/TalmudicClockApp/) is a modern sun-dial designed to display the hour of the day as calculated in Jewish law with reference to the varying lengths of the days and nights. It also allows you to list Jewish prayer times.

## Usage

The "Talmudic Clock App' opens with basic page info and instructions. Clicking the "exit" button 
renders the analog-clock interface. As described in the info section, this clock displays the
"talmudic hour". The Talmud uses "temporal hours" ("Shaos Zmanios" in Hebrew) which are one twelfth of the day (sunrise to sunset) and night (sunset to sunrise) to calculate correct prayer times.

Clicking on the settings gear (located at the bottom-right
of the view-port) will display a list of new options.

From here one can select:
1. "Info"
      * To display the app info.
2. "List Prayer Times"
      * To display a list of prayer times for your current location.
3. "Change Location"
      * To change location by zip-code.
      * This will also update both the analog and digital clocks, as well as prayer times, to coincide with the selected location.
4. "Report a Problem"
      * To email the developer with any user experience problem.
